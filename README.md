Hi, I’m Jeffrey, a new person to coding as of 2020, I don't really know much about coding, but fuck it, JavaScript seems good, and python is a bit weird
<br><br>My discord is LegoMyEggoNerd#5143 if you ever need to reach me, simply state you came from GitHub

<!---fuck--->
I kinda guess I know HTML, trying out Python, and am fairly decent with JavaScript, I wanna learn more Java or some language of C other than Css, so that's my next goal<br>
I've been working on a Discord™ Bot, called Jeffrey Bot, so fuck it, that's probably going to be my most active repo when I move all the code here, I just kinda got it on a RasPi4 B+
